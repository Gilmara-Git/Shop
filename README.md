## Motivation
Practice **React Native** fundamentals such as Components, styling, font, Images, Button(TouchableOpacity, TouchableNativeFeedback), Lists (ScrollView and FlatList), navigation and state management with Redux) and Typescript.

## Improvements
Applied customized style for components and pages.
Used 'Dimensions API' to adjust fontSize on buttons whenever screen width is smaller than 350.


<!-- <p>In order to practice LinearGradient, I styled the FallBack Screen with LinearGradient. FallBack screen is the page displayed when the there is no Meals being filtered or there is no Meal in Favorites.</p> -->

<!-- ## Improvements to be applied
- Adapt the 'app' to be used on smaller devices and landscape position, by explorinng the advantages of Dimensions API) -->


## Technologies used
- React Native
- Typescript 
- Expo
- React Navigation v4 (stackNavigator and  drawerNavigator)
- Redux (Global state management)
- Used Lib 'moment' on models > 'order.js' to output 'date' in details on Android as the built in JS method(toLocaleDateString) only outputs 'date' in details on iOS. This is due to how JS engine works in Android.
